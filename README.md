# Hello, World! 👋

I'm John Mark, a curious coder stepping into the world of Python! 🐍

### 🌱 Currently Learning
I'm still diving deep into Python, exploring the basics, and starting to write scripts that make my life easier. I'm currently fascinated by how a few lines of code can automate tasks, solve problems, and create something new from scratch.
