# Hello, World! 👋

I'm John Mark, a curious coder stepping into the world of Python! 🐍

### 🌱 Currently Learning
I'm still diving deep into Python, exploring the basics, and starting to write scripts that make my life easier. I'm currently fascinated by how a few lines of code can automate tasks, solve problems, and create something new from scratch.

### 🎯 Goals
- Get comfortable with Python syntax and basic concepts.
- Master the fundamentals and the functions of Python
- Pass the Skill Tests :')
- Apply my learnings and build unique innovative things enough to share with the world.
